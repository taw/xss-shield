xss-shield
==========

Rails plugin protecting against XSS attacks.

Note
====

This plugin was developed for Rails 1.2.x.
Rails these days includes XSS protection system very similar to XSS Shield,
so unless you use very old version of Rails, this project is probably of mostly historical value.

Description
===========

XSS Shield protects your views against cross-site scripting attacks without error-prone manual escaping with `h()`.

Instead of:

    <h3><%= h(item.name) %></h3>
    <p><%= link_to "#{h(item.first_name)}'s stuff", :action => :view, :id => item %></p>


You will be able to write:

    <h3><%= item.name %></h3>
    <p><%= link_to "#{item.first_name}'s stuff", :action => :view, :id => item %></p>


and all your views will be automatically protected.
Protection works by tagging strings you trust - which are only those escaped by `h()`,
generated by trusted helpers (like `link_to`, `text_area`, `will_paginate` etc.),
or explicitly marked as trusted by you. If untrusted string is to be displayed in a template it is h-escaped first.

XSS Shield supports RHTML and [http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/ HAML].

To install the plugin run:

    ./script/plugin install -x http://xss-shield.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/xss-shield/
